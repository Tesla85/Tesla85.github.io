        <p class="p">
            I am originally from Cincinnati Ohio, and moved down south to the Carolinas when I was 13.
            I have been back and forth between the Carlinas and Tennessee since that time, from Fort Mill, SC, to 
            Charlotte, NC to Koxville, TN to Nashville, TN. 
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            In 2004 I graduated High School in Fort Mill, and went on to attend the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.
            From there I graduated with a BA in Phsychology in 2009. The job market was not fantastic when I graduated, and
            I ended up working three jobs just to make ends meet. I was working at a resturant, Best Buy, and a strapping factory 
            in Lancaster. It was during that time around 2010 That I decided to obtain my Insurance Adjusters license
            in order to be able survive without killing myself by working three jobs. I worked in insurance for the past 7 years, but finaly decided it was time to move on with a new career.
            With this class, I hope to be able to realize my dream of being able to not only provide a comfortable life for myself and my family,
            but to be able to finaly pursue my dreams of becoming an entrepreneur or working for a company in a field in which I enjoy.
